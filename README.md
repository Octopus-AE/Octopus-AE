# Octopus: Efficient Hypergraph Pattern Mining with Practical Processing-in-Memory Architecture
## Project Overview

**Octopus** is an efficient hypergraph pattern mining (HPM) framework for the UPMEM **Processing-in-Memory (PIM)** architecture.

The goal of Octopus is to accelerate HPM tasks on large-scale hypergraphs using UPMEM DPUs. It integrates several system-level optimizations tailored for near-data processing architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Fast hypergraph pattern mining for large-scale hypergraphs.
- Schedule-based compact data partitioning for collectively facilitate compact data organization.
- Load-aware balanced task assignment for balanced execution across thousands of DPUs.
- Hyperedge-level candidate generation for reduced computation.
- Asynchronous loader–worker pipeline using WRAM FIFO.

## 🛠 Requirements

- **Linux environment**
- **UPMEM SDK v2025.1.0.**
- **GNU Make, C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)**

## ⚙️ Build and Run Instructions

To run HPM on a hypergraph, use:

```bash
make clean
GRAPH=<hypergraph_name> PATTERN=<pattern_name> make test
```

Example:

```bash
GRAPH=SB PATTERN=HYP2_3_4_6 make test
```

> 💡 The available values for `GRAPH` and `PATTERN` are defined in `include/common.h`.  
> To add new hypergraphs or patterns, modify `common.h` and recompile.
